## Context
Property prices registered within the Republic of Ireland during 2020.

## Content
This dataset contains the following columns:

- Date of sale : format (DATE : dd/mm/yyyy), represents the day that the property was registered for tax purposes as a purchased property
- Address : format (STRING : free text), contains all lines from a properties address
- Postal code : format (STRING : free text), contains the postal code for the property
- County : format (STRING : free text), contains the county which represents area of the country
- Price (â‚¬) : format (NUMERIC), price for property purchase
- Not full market price : format (BOOLEAN), not the full price due to a variety of reasons
- VAT exclusive : format (BOOLEAN), If the property is a new property, the price shown should be exclusive of VAT at 13.5%.
- Description of property : format (CATEGORY), shows if the property is a new or second hand building
- Property size description : format (CATEGORY), relative size of the property
- The Residential Property Price Register is produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) pursuant to section 86 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011. It includes Date of Sale, Price and Address of all residential properties purchased in Ireland since the 1st January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes.

It is important to note that the Register is not intended as a "Property Price Index".

In a small number of transactions included in the Register the price shown does not represent the full market price of the property concerned for a variety of reasons. All such properties are marked **.

Where a property is part residential and part non-residential (e.g. living quarters over a shop) the Register will only contain information about the residential part.

## Inspiration
Potential ideas to review

- How the property price changes during 2020
- Does the location of a property influence the price
- Best techniques that could be used to improve the accuracy of the data
- Methods to reduce the number of missing values
- Extracting additional information from the address variable to store in new columns
- Data visualizations to highlight the changing trends relative to time and location
- Can multiple property purchases be identified e.g. registration of multiple apartments
